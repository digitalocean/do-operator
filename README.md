# `do-operator`: The Kubernetes Operator for DigitalOcean

`do-operator` is a Kubernetes operator for managing and consuming [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) resources from a Kubernetes cluster.

Currently it supports [DigitalOcean Managed Databases](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/managed-databases).

## Status

**This project is in BETA.**

* This operator should not be depended upon for production use at this time.
* The CRDs in this project are currently `v1alpha1` and may change in the future.
* DigitalOcean supports this project on a best-effort basis via GitHub issues.

**If you have already enabled `do-operator` by clicking `Add database operator` button from cloud control panel UI while creating your `DOKS` cluster, please `DO NOT` install it again.**

## Quick Start

To install the operator on a Kubernetes cluster, you can follow these steps:

1. Install cert-manager (if not already installed):
```sh
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.9.1/cert-manager.yaml
```
2. Generate a [DigitalOcean API token](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/create-personal-access-token/) and base64 encode it.
3. Edit the manifest for the most recent version in the `releases/` directory. Find the `do-operator-do-api-token` Secret and replace the `access-token` value with your base64-encoded token:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  access-token: <your base64-encoded token goes here>
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: do-operator-do-api-token
  namespace: do-operator-system
type: Opaque
```
4. Deploy the manifest:
```sh
kubectl apply -f releases/do-operator-<version>.yaml
```

## Usage

See the full documentation in the [docs](docs/) directory.

## Development

The `do-operator` is built using [kubebuilder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder).
The [Kubebuilder Book](https://book.kubebuilder.io/) is a useful reference for understanding how the pieces fit together.

To test your changes you will need a Kubernetes cluster to run against.
We suggest using [DigitalOcean Kubernetes](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes/), but you may use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) or any other cluster for testing.
The following will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

**Note that you will be billed for any DigitalOcean resources you create via the operator while testing.**
Make sure you are aware of [DigitalOcean's pricing](https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing) and clean up resources when you're finished testing.

### Building and Installing

1. Install the Custom Resource Definitions:

```sh
make install
```

**Note M1 Macbook users:** this project is made with Kubebuilder which uses `Kustomize v3.8.7` which doesn't have an ARM release and so you need to [manually install kustomize](#manually-installing-kustomize-m1-mac-users) for this step to succeed

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG` (in the [Makefile](Makefile)):

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/do-operator:tag
```

3. [Deploy cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/), which is necessary to manage certificates for the webhooks.

4. Generate a [DigitalOcean API token](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/create-personal-access-token/) to use for testing.

5. Create a local environment file containing your API token. Note that this file is in the `.gitignore` so it will remain local to your machine:

```sh
cat <<EOF > config/manager/do-api-token.env
access-token=<your api token here>
EOF
```

The contents of this file will be used to create a secret in the cluster, which is used by the operator deployment to manage resources in your DigitalOcean account.

6. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/do-operator:tag
```

### Undeploying the Controller

To undeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

### Uninstalling the CRDs

To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Manually Installing Kustomize (M1 Mac users)
1. Clone the [Kustomize project](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize)
2. Go to the `v3.5.7` branch: `git checkout kustomize/v3.8.7`
3. Go into the `kustomize` folder (so from the project root it would be `kustomize/kustomize/`)
4. `go build .`
5. Now move the generated `kustomize` binary into the `bin` directory in this project (create it if it doesn't exist `mkdir bin`): `mv kustomize <project path>/bin/kustomize`

### Update Go and dependencies
1. Update Go version in
   1. [go.mod](./go.mod)
   2. [.github/workflows/release.yml](./.github/workflows/release.yml)
   3. [.github/workflows/test.yml](./.github/workflows/test.yml)
   4. [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile)
2. Update Go dependencies
   ```shell
   go get -u ./...
   go mod tidy
   go mod vendor
   ```
3. Run `make test`
4. Create and merge PR

### Release
1. Create release manifest files by running `IMG_TAG=vX.Y.Z make release-manifests`
2. Create and merge PR
3. [Trigger the `release` GitHub action workflow](https://github.com/digitalocean/do-operator/actions/workflows/release.yml)
    - Draft a new release [here](https://github.com/digitalocean/do-operator/releases) for the new version
    - Creating a new release will trigger the [release](https://github.com/digitalocean/do-operator/actions/workflows/release.yml) Github Action
    - Follow the [release](https://github.com/digitalocean/do-operator/actions/workflows/release.yml) Github Action until successful completion.
